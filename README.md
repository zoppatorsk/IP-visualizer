# IP Visualizer

IP visualizer is a tool for visualizing IP addresses on a map inside a selected area determined by a radius drawn by the user.

Live demo available at [https://ipv.karate.monster](https://ipv.karate.monster)

Simply click on the crosshair button to activate select mode. Click anywhere on the map and drag to select a radius.

To cancel out of selection mode without drawing simply right click or press escape button.

When finished selecting the area, data is fetched and visualized on the map. The layer controller allows the user to switch between the different visualization layers and options.

In some layers you can click on an entity to see more information.

# Overview video (Optional)

Here's a short video that explains the project and how it uses Redis:

[Insert your own video here, and remove the one below]

## How it works

The user activates the select mode by clicking the crosshair button.\
When this mode is selected the mouse position will be captured when the user left click with the mouse.\
When user moves the mouse while the button is pressed a circle will be drawn. The circle radius will be calculated with the help of the [Turf.js](https://turfjs.org/) library.\
Once the user releases the mouse button the circle will be drawn on the map as a polygon with the help of Turf.js.\
At the same time a post request is sent to the server with the starting coordinates and the radius.\
This data is then used sent to Redis with a request to get all the IP-addresses within the specified radius of the starting coordinates.\
The IP-address data is then sent back to the client and with help of [deck.gl](https://deck.gl/) it is visualized on the map.

### How the data is stored:

The data is stored in Redis using the GEOADD command.
The first parameter is the name of the "set" that the data belongs to, followed by the coordinates for longitude and latitude. The last parameter is the range of IP-addresses in CIDR format.

Here is an exmaple of the command: GEOADD ips -115.171971 36.120609 182.134.22.20/22

The application itself do not change the data (with the exeception of the ratelimiter I'm using), it only fetches it, so it needs to be loaded into Redis before being used.
This can be done automatically by using the "update-data" script.
It will download the necessary .csv file and give options on how to load it into Redis, either the fast approach by using redis-cli if available or the slower way by using the redis-client.

This shows the function when loading data with the redis-cli. The encodeRedis function implements the needed protocol.

```js
import { spawn } from 'child_process';
import { createReadStream } from 'fs';
import CsvReadableStream from 'csv-reader';

const uri = process.env.REDIS_CONNECT_STRING;
const redisPipe = spawn(`redis-cli`, ['-u', `${uri}`, '--pipe']);

redisPipe.on('error', function (err) {
	console.log('Failed spawning redis-cli, check your REDIS_CONNECT_STRING in .env or try slow loading instead');
	process.exit();
});

redisPipe.stdout.setEncoding('utf8');
redisPipe.stdout.pipe(process.stdout);
redisPipe.stderr.pipe(process.stderr);

const BUFFER_SIZE = 524288; // 512KB
let buffer = '';

async function updateWithCLI(file) {
	let inputStream = createReadStream(file, 'utf8');
	console.log('Pleas wait...');

	inputStream
		.pipe(new CsvReadableStream({ asObject: true }))
		.on('data', async function (row) {
			if (row.longitude && row.latitude) {
				buffer += encodeRedis(`geoadd ips ${row.longitude} ${row.latitude} ${row.network}`);
				//when buffer is filled then write it n empty buffer.
				if (buffer.length > BUFFER_SIZE) {
					redisPipe.stdin.write(buffer);
					buffer = '';
				}
			}
		})
		.on('end', async function () {
			redisPipe.stdin.write(buffer); //write the remaining buffer if any left
			redisPipe.stdin.end();
			console.log('Update complete');
			process.exit();
		});
}

function encodeRedis(dataString) {
	const dataArr = dataString.split(' '); //put data in array
	let msg = '*' + dataArr.length + '\r\n'; //create start of message with amount of args

	for (let i = 0; i < dataArr.length; i++) {
		msg += '$' + dataArr[i].length + '\r\n' + dataArr[i] + '\r\n'; //encode the data
	}
	return msg; //return the encoded message
}
export default updateWithCLI;
```

Below is function used for loading the data into Redis using the node redis-client.

```js
import { createClient } from 'redis';
import CsvReadableStream from 'csv-reader';
import { createReadStream } from 'fs';
const redisClient = createClient({ url: process.env.REDIS_CONNECT_STRING });

async function slowLoad(file) {
	await redisClient.connect().catch((err) => {
		console.error('Failed to to connect to redis! Check your REDIS_CONNECT_STRING in .env');
		process.exit();
	});

	let inputStream = createReadStream(file, 'utf8');
	let counter = 0;
	inputStream
		.pipe(new CsvReadableStream({ asObject: true }))
		.on('data', async function (row) {
			if (row.longitude && row.latitude) {
				try {
					await redisClient.sendCommand(['GEOADD', 'ips', row.longitude + '', row.latitude + '', row.network]);
					counter++;
					console.log(`${counter} rows processed`);
				} catch (error) {
					console.error('redis_err', error);
				}
			}
		})
		.on('end', async function () {
			console.log('Update complete');
			process.exit();
		});
}

export default slowLoad;
```

Refer to [this example](https://github.com/redis-developer/basic-analytics-dashboard-redis-bitmaps-nodejs#how-the-data-is-stored) for a more detailed example of what you need for this section.

### How the data is accessed:

Accessing the data is done on the server and really simple.
It uses the node redis client and just send the GEORADIUS command with the name of the set, coordinates for the center point of the circle and the radius in kilometers.
The withcord parameter is set to true, so the results are returned with the coordinates .

The paramters for coordinates and radius is ofcourse sent from the client side of the application.

```js
const data = await redisClient.sendCommand(['GEORADIUS', 'ips', lng + '', lat + '', radius + '', 'km', 'WITHCOORD']);
```

The data is then parsed into a more usable format and sent back to the client.

## How to run it locally?

If only want to run locally and not do any development work you only need the dist folder. This folder contains the backend server and in the public folder is a compiled version of the frontend that will be served by the backend server.

1. Go to the dist folder and run npm install to install all the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

2. You will need to change the .env file and set valid REDIS_CONNECT_STRING for your Redis instance.

3. You need to load data into Redis. For this a license key to use GeoLite2 from MaxMind is needed. It is free to get and you can sign up at the [MaxMind website](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data?lang=en).

4. Put the license key as MAXMIND_KEY in the .env file.
5. Now run the command

```bash
npm run update-data
```

This will download the needed file and you get a choice to load the data into Redis with the redis-cli or the node redis client.
The redis-cli is faster but you need to have the redis-cli installed to use it. The node redis client is slower but an option if you don't have the cli.

If you for some reason want to handle the data loading yourself, you can parse the .csv into a simple textfile with the Redis commands.

6. Start the app

```bash
node index.js
or
node .
or
npm run start
```

7. Open the browser and go to http://localhost:3000/

### Prerequisites

Node, Preferably LTS (v16.16.0) but tested and working with v16.7

[MaxMind GeoLite2](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data?lang=en) License Key

A Redis instance with enough capacity to fit the data, around 200MB of storage should be enough.

### Configuration Options

Configuration is done in the .env file.

```js
API_PORT = 3000;
USE_PROXY = 'false';
NEED_CORS = 'false';
REDIS_CONNECT_STRING = 'redis://localhost:6379';
MAXMIND_KEY = 'your maxmind key';
LISTEN = '';
```

API_PORT: is the port the server will listen on.\
USE_PROXY: setting this to 'true' makes Express trust the X-Forwarded-\* headers. Use this if running server with a reverse proxy so ratelimiting works like intended.\
NEED_CORS: setting this to 'true' makes Express allow CORS requests. It is not needed if serving the frontend from the backend api\
REDIS_CONNECT_STRING: is the connection URI for the redis instance.\
MAXMIND_KEY: is the license key for the MaxMind GeoLite2 database.\
LISTEN: can be set to 'localhost', this means the server will listen to localhost only. Is usefull if running server behind reverse proxy.\

## Deployment

Direct deployment to cloud is not supported. I don't do cloud! If wan't to deploy to cloud, you will have to figure it out yourself.
Deploy the way you usually do other node projects. I prefer to run them with PM2 behind a Nginx reverse proxy.

### Considerations if deploying to server running reverse proxy.

If reverseproxy the connection to IP visualizer you should set the "USE_PROXY" to "true" in the .env file

## Development

Want to mess around with the code or do your own development?

### Server

The server folder holds all the code for the backend server. It is just a simple express API.\
The .env file needs to be changed just as described in "How to run it locally?"\
The other needed options are already set so NEED_CORS will be set to true as frontend will be run on a different port.
Same as before the server is started with node index.js or simply node .

```bash
node index.js
or
node .
or
npm run start
```

### Client/frontend

The client is in the client folder, it is a Svelte application and uses Vite.
To start up the client run the command

```bash
npm run dev
```

For production build that is meant to be served from the backends public folder run

```bash
npm run build --production
```

This will use the .env.production file and set the api path to the correct url.

If you want to serve client independently from a regular webserver you can run

```bash
npm run build
```

If doing so you need to make sure the api url/port is set correctly in the .env file before to match the backend server.\
The server will also need to have CORS enabled and you should also set the allowed origins for it. See the [documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cors.html) for more information.
